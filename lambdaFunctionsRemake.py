#Today we will discuss about the lambda functions in python

#Making a fumction to do the sum of any two numbers inputted by the user

sum = lambda x,y: x+y

print(f"The result of addition is:{sum(3,5)}")

#Now making a long function of sum
def sum1(a,b):
    return a+b

print(f"The sum of the long function is:{sum1(3,5)}")
