# Python Mastering 🚀

Welcome to **Python Mastering**, where I share my personal journey from an intermediate Python programmer to an advanced one. This repository contains real projects, practice exercises, and advanced concepts that I’ve learned along the way.

## 🧠 Purpose

The goal of this repo is to:
- Sharpen my Python skills
- Document my learning path
- Help others who are also transitioning from intermediate to advanced Python
- Build a strong foundation for ethical hacking and automation

## 📁 What's Inside

- ✅ Intermediate-level scripts and exercises  
- 🚀 Advanced concepts like:
  - Decorators & Generators
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - File I/O and Error Handling
  - Working with APIs and JSON
  - Web scraping
  - Automation with Python
  - Multithreading and Async programming
  - Useful libraries: `requests`, `os`, `sys`, `argparse`, `datetime`, and more
- 📚 Real-world mini-projects

## 📌 Roadmap (Coming Soon)
I'll keep updating the repository with:
- Topic-wise folders
- README inside each folder to explain the logic
- Links to resources or tutorials I found helpful
